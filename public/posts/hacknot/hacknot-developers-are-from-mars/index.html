    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Many of us use the terms &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;developer&rdquo; interchangeably. When
someone asks me what I do for a living I tend to describe my vocation as
&ldquo;computer programmer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;software developer&rdquo;, because the former seems
to be understood more readily by those unfamiliar with IT. Even when writing
pieces for this site, I tend to swap back and forth between the two terms, to
try and avoid sounding repetitive. But in truth, there is a world of difference
between a computer programmer and a software developer.</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; has historically referred to a menial, manual input task
conducted by an unskilled worker. Predecessors of the computer, such as the
Hollerith machine, would be fed encoded instructions by operators called
&ldquo;programmers&rdquo;. Early electro-mechanical, valve and relay- based computers were
huge and expensive machines, operated within an institutional environment whose
hierarchical division of labor involved, at the lowest level, a &ldquo;button pusher&rdquo;
whose task was to laboriously program the device according to instructions
developed by those higher up the technical ladder. So the programmer role is
traditionally concerned only with the input of data in machine-compatible form,
and not with the relevance or adequacy of those instructions when executed.</p>
<p>A modern programmer loves cutting code – and only cutting code. They
delight in code the way a writer delights in text. Programmers see their sole
function in an organization as being the production of code, and view any task
that doesn&rsquo;t involve having their hands on the keyboard as an unwanted
distraction.</p>
<p>Developers like to code as well, but they see it as being only a part of their
job function. They focus more on delivering value than delivering program text,
and know that they can&rsquo;t create value without having an awareness of the
business context into which they will deploy their application, and the
organizational factors that impact upon its success once delivered.</p>
<p>More specifically &hellip;</p>
<p>Developers Know Something Of The Domain And The Business</p>
<p>Programmers like to stay as ignorant as possible of the business within which
they work. They consider the problem domain to be the realm of the
non-technical, and neither their problem or concern. You&rsquo;ll hear programmers
express their indifference to the business within which they operate - they
don&rsquo;t care if it&rsquo;s finance, health or telecommunications. For them, the domain
is just an excuse to exercise a set of programming technologies.</p>
<p>Developers view the business domain as their &ldquo;second job.&rdquo; They work to develop
a solid understanding of those aspects of it that impact upon their software,
then use that knowledge to determine what the real business problems are that
the application is meant to be solving. They make an effort to get inside the
heads of their user base – to see the software as the users will see
it. This perspective enables them to anticipate requirements that may not have
occurred to the users, and to discover opportunities to add business value that
the users may have been unaware was technically possible.</p>
<p>Developers Care About Maintenance Burden</p>
<p>Programmers crave new technologies the way children crave sweets. It&rsquo;s a hunger
that can never be satiated. They are forever flitting from one programming
language, framework, library or IDE to the next; forever gushing
enthusiastically about the latest silver bullet to have been grunted out by some
vendor or open source enthusiast, and garnished with naive praise and marketing
hype. They won&rsquo;t hesitate to incorporate the newest technology into critical
parts of their current project, for no reason other than that it is &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, and
all the other kids are doing it. They will be so intent on getting this new
technology working, and overcoming the inevitable troubles that immature
technologies bring, that there will be no time to spare for documentation of
their effort. Which is exactly how they like it – because
documentation is, they believe, of no use to them. Sure, it might be useful to
future generations of programmers, but who cares about them?</p>
<p>Developers have a much more cautious approach to new technology. They know that
a new technology is inevitably hyped through the roof by those with a vested
interest in its success, but that the reality of the technology&rsquo;s performance in
the field often falls short of the spectacular claims made by proponents. They
know that a technology that is new is also unproven, and that its weaknesses and
shortcomings are neither well known or publicized. They know that part of the
reason it takes time for the negative experiences with technologies to become
apparent is that many developers will be hesitant to say something critical
amongst that first flush of community enthusiasm, for fear that they will be
shouted down by the newly-converted zealots, or dismissed as laggards who have
fallen behind the curve. So developers know to stand back and wait for the hype
to die down, and for cooler heads to prevail. Developers also know the
organizational chaos that can result from too many changes in technical
direction. A company can quickly accumulate a series of legacy applications,
each written in a host of once-popular technologies, that few (if any) currently
on staff possess the skills to maintain and extend. Those that first championed
those technologies and forced them into production may have long since moved
onto other enthusiasms, perhaps other organizations, leaving behind the
byproduct of their fleeting infatuation as a maintenance burden for the
organization and future staff to bare.</p>
<p>Developers Know That Work Methods Are More Important Than Technical Chops</p>
<p>Programmers often focus so intently upon the technologies they use that they
come to believe that technology is the dominant factor influencing the ultimate
success or otherwise of their projects. The mind set becomes one of constantly
looking over the horizon for the next thing that might solve their software
development woes. The expectation becomes &ldquo;Everything will be better once we
switch to technology X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Developers know that this &ldquo;grass is greener&rdquo; effect is a falsehood –
one often promulgated by vendors, marketers and technology evangelists in their
quest to sell a product. The dominant factors influencing the quality of your
application, and ultimately its success or otherwise, are the quality of the
people doing the development and the work methods that they follow. In most
cases, technology choice is almost incidental (the one possible exception being
where there is a generational, revolutionary change in technology, such as the
transition from low level to high level programming languages). Therefore
developers frequently posses an interest in QA and software engineering
techniques that their programmer counterparts do not.</p>
<p>Programmers Try To Solve Every Problem By Coding</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the programmer mentality that every problem they
encounter is perceived as an opportunity to write more code. A typical
manifestation is the presence of a &ldquo;tools guy&rdquo; on a development team. This is
the guy who is continually writing new scripts and utilities to facilitate the
development process, even if the process he is automating is only performed once
in a blue moon, meaning that there is more effort expended in writing the tool
than the resulting automation will ever save.</p>
<p>Developers know that coding effort is best reserved for the application itself.
After all, this is what you are being paid to produce. They know that tool
development is only useful to a point, after which it becomes just a
self-indulgent distraction from the task at hand. Typically, a retreat sought by
those with a love of &ldquo;plumbing&rdquo; and infrastructure-level development. Developers
know that there are many development tasks that it is simply not worth
automating and, where possible, will buy their development tools rather than
roll their own, as this is the most time- and cost-efficient way of meeting
their needs. Developers Seek Repeatability, Programmers Like One-Off Heroics</p>
<p>If development were an Aesop&rsquo;s fable, then programmers would be the hares, and
developers the tortoises. Programmers, prone to an over- confidence resulting
from excessive faith in technology&rsquo;s ability to save the day, will find
themselves facing impending deadlines with work still to go that was meant to be
made &ldquo;easy&rdquo; by that technology, but was unexpectedly time-consuming. Not
surprisingly, the technology doesn&rsquo;t ameliorate the impact of too little
forethought and planning. These last- minute saves, and the concentrated effort
they require, are later interpreted as evidence of commitment and conviction,
rewarded as such, and thereby perpetuated.</p>
<p>Developers are very aware that there are no silver bullets, be they
methodological or technological. Rather than pinning their hopes on new methods
or tools, they settle down to a period of detailed analysis and planning, during
which they do their best to anticipate the road ahead and the sorts of obstacles
they will encounter. They only proceed when they feel that they can do so
without entertaining too much risk of making faulty assumptions, and having to
later throw work away.</p>
<p>Programmers Like Complexity, Developers Favor Simplicity</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not uncommon for programmers to deliberately over-engineer the solutions
they produce, simply because they enjoy having a more complex problem to solve.
They may introduce requirements that are actually quite unnecessary, but which
give them the opportunity to employ some technology that they have been itching
to play with. Their users will have to bear this extra complexity in their every
interaction with the system; maintenance programmers will have to wade through
it in every fix and patch; the company will have to finance the extensions to
the project schedule necessary to support the additional implementation effort;
but the programmers care about none of this – as long as they get to
play with a shiny new tech toy.</p>
<p>Developers continually seek the simplest possible resolution to all the design
forces impinging on their project, regardless of how cool or trendy the
technology path it takes them down. If the project&rsquo;s best interests are served
by implementing in Visual Basic, then VB is what you use, even though VB isn&rsquo;t
cool and may not be something you really want to see on your CV. If the problem
doesn&rsquo;t demand a distributed solution, with all the scalability that such an
architecture provides, then you don&rsquo;t foist a distributed architecture upon the
project just so you can get some experience with the technologies involved, or
just because it is possible to fabricate some specious &ldquo;what if&rdquo; scenario to
justify its usage, even though this scenario is never likely to occur in a real
business context.</p>
<p>Developers Care About Users</p>
<p>Programmers often view their user base with disdain or even outright contempt,
as if they are the ignorant hordes to whose low technical literacy they must
pander. They refer to them as &ldquo;lusers&rdquo;, and laugh at their relative inexperience
with computing technology. Their attitude is one of &ldquo;What a shame we have to
waste our elite programming skills solving your petty problems&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll take
whatever I give you and be thankful for it.&rdquo; Programmers delight in throwing
technical jargon at the user base, knowing that it won&rsquo;t be understood, because
it enables them to feel superior. They are quick to brush off the user&rsquo;s
requests for help or additional functionality, justifying their laziness by
appealing to &ldquo;technical reasons&rdquo; that are too involved to go into.</p>
<p>Developers don&rsquo;t consider users beneath them, but recognize and respect that
they just serve the organization in a different capacity. Their contribution is
no less important for that. When speaking with users, they try to eliminate
unnecessary technical jargon from their speech, and instead adopt terminology
more familiar to the user. They presume that requests for functionality or
guidance are well intended, and endeavor to objectively appraise the worth of
user&rsquo;s requests in terms of business value rather than personal appeal.</p>
<p>Developers Like To Satisfy A Need, Programmers Like To Finish</p>
<p>Programmers tend to rush headlong into tasks, spending little time considering
boundary conditions, low-level details, integration issues and so on. They are
keen to get typing as soon as possible, and convince themselves that the details
can be sorted out later on. The worst that could happen is that they&rsquo;ll have to
abandon what they&rsquo;ve done and rewrite it – which would simply be an
opportunity to do more coding and perhaps switch technologies as well. They
enjoy this trial and error approach, because it keeps activity focused around
the coding.</p>
<p>Developers know that the exacting nature of programming means that &ldquo;more haste&rdquo;
often leads to &ldquo;less speed.&rdquo; They are also mindful of the temptation to leap
into coding a solution before having fully understood the problem. Therefore
they will take the time to ensure that they understand the intricacies of the
problem, and the business need behind it. Their intent is to solve a business
problem, not just to close an issue in a bug tracking system.</p>
<p>Developers Work, Programmers Play</p>
<p>Many software developers enter the work force as programmers, having developed
an interest in software from programmer-like, hobbyist activities. Once they
learn something of the role that software plays in an organizational context,
their sphere of concern broadens to encompass all those other activities that
constitute the difference between programmer and developer, as described above.</p>
<p>However, some never make the attitudinal transition from the amateur to the
professional, and continue to &ldquo;play&rdquo; with computers in the same way they always
have, but do so at an employer&rsquo;s expense. Many will never even appreciate that
there could be much more to their work, if only they were willing to step up to
the challenge and responsibility.</p>
<p>Software engineering, not yet a true profession, places no minimum standards and
requirements upon practitioners. Until that changes, hobbyist programmers will
remain free to masquerade as software development professionals.</p>
<p>It is the developers that you want working in your organization. Programmers are
a dime a dozen, but developers can bring real value to a business. Wise
employers know how to tell the difference.</p>
