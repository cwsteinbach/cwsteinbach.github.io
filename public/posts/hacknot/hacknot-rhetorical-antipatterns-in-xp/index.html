    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Over the past few years, I’ve spent more time in consideration of XP and its followers than is in the best interests of one’s mental health. My pre-occupation with it springs from my broader interest in skepticism. It’s fascinating to watch the same forces that drive cults, pseudo-science and other popular delusions at work in one’s own profession. It’s like driving past a road accident. It’s tragic and disturbing, but so entrancing that you just can’t look away.</p>
<p>One of the aspects of XP that is particularly intriguing is the way that certain rhetorical devices are used repeatedly to prop up the XP belief system in the face an uncooperative reality.</p>
<p>This post describes the four main rhetorical devices that XPers use to influence their audience and each other. Once you see how it’s done, you’ll find yourself able to &ldquo;talk XP&rdquo; like a native.</p>
<p>The four techniques are:
• AdoptAToneOfAuthorityAndEschewEquivocation • MakeBoldAssertionsAndBroadGeneralizations
• UseEvidenceWhoseVeracityCanNotBeChallenged • CreateSlogansAndNeologisms</p>
<h2 id="adopt-a-tone-of-authority-and-eschew-equivocation">Adopt A Tone Of Authority And Eschew Equivocation</h2>
<p>No matter what questions you might have, there is someone out there that is willing to sell you the answers. And although the vendors come in many different forms they have one characteristic in common – they all appear absolutely sincere and absolutely sure of themselves. So must you be if you are to talk like a true XPer.
Fortunately, the impression of authority is easily created with some linguistic sleight of hand:
• Never qualify your statements or concede error. If you say &ldquo;I don’t think that is true&rdquo; nobody will notice. But if you say &ldquo;That is absolutely false&rdquo; you can capture people’s interest and attention.
• Intimate that you are speaking on behalf of others. For example, the statement &ldquo;Software developers don’t work that way&rdquo; is more compelling than the statement &ldquo;I don’t work that way.&rdquo; Stating that &ldquo;Everybody knows X&rdquo; is more impressive than stating &ldquo;I know X.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exercise some restraint with these techniques. It’s easy to go too far and sound like a born-again prophet. You will find it useful to temper your pontifications with the occasional self-deprecatory statement, just to make it clear to your audience that although you know you are very wise, you don’t think you’re the Messiah.
Another way of elevating your own perceived authority is to denigrate others. For example, those not enamored of pair programming may be accused of being socially inept or sociopathic. More recently, we have seen attempts to attribute a distaste for pair programming to genetic disorders such as autism and Asperger’s syndrome. Statements so personal are delightfully controversial, and can also be used to goad detractors into overly emotive responses, which can be interpreted as further evidence of mental instability. Applied frequently enough, such pathologizing will discourage your detractors from making public criticisms, knowing that they will be virtually waving their &ldquo;freak flag&rdquo; for all the world to see.</p>
<p>Finally, boost your own credibility by borrowing it from elsewhere. Make occasional references to:
• Easternphilosophiesandspiritualtraditions
• Movies,literatureandpersonalitiesfrompopculture
• Advancedmathematicsandphysics,particularlychaostheoryand quantum mechanics
• Politicalideologies</p>
<h2 id="make-bold-assertions-and-broad-generalizations">Make Bold Assertions And Broad Generalizations</h2>
<p>XP rhetoric is characterized by broad and sweeping generalizations about software development practice, projects and developers. A classic example is the following, from Kent Beck:</p>
<p>Unacknowledged fear is the source of all software project failures.1</p>
<p>It takes a special kind of person to make such claims – specifically, one that is breathtakingly arrogant. If this arrogance doesn’t come naturally to you, then you will have to affect it. The more spectacular and entertaining your statements, the better the chance that they will be turned into a sound bite or quoted by a journalist. The media loves attention grabbing one- liners and there is little you can say that is so ridiculous that the determined reader will not find some way to interpret it as both meaningful and insightful.</p>
<p>Do not let an absence of supporting evidence constrain your imagination. If detractors point out exceptions to your generalizations, simply dismiss those exceptions as being so atypical or statistically insignificant as to not warrant revision of an otherwise useful rule of thumb.</p>
<p>In argument, coupling these generalizations with baseless assertions is an effective &ldquo;one-two&rdquo; punch to your opponent’s frontal lobes. If they should be rendered speechless at the audacity of your statements, seize the opportunity to change the subject or offer some non-sequitur, so that they will not have the opportunity to challenge you.</p>
<p>Most importantly, remember that the credibility of your propositions rests almost exclusively on your ability to deliver them with absolute conviction. The software development community are a gullible lot, and provided that you sound like you know what you’re talking about, a great number of them will simply assume that you’ve got the facts to back it up. For those unencumbered by integrity, this is the ideal flock to lead out of the programmatic wilderness, if only you can make the cattle-call compelling enough.</p>
<p>To get you started, here are some bold assertions and baseless generalizations that are anti-XP in nature. Feel free to use them in your next exchange with an XPer.
• It is inevitable that XP will fade into technical obscurity, just like every other fad the software industry has witnessed in the last thirty years.
• The fervor with which XPers cling to their code-centric methodology betrays the underlying fear which drives them: the fear that if they should ever stop typing someone might realize that coding is their only skill. In a modern business context the ability to code is useless if not accompanied, in equal or greater measure, by the ability to perform a whole host of non-coding activities that XP does not even address.
• Extreme programming is not about programming. It is about the attempts of a small group of attention-seeking individuals to make their mark on the computing landscape.
• The irony of Extreme Programming is that to make it work in the real world, you have to moderate the &ldquo;extremeness&rdquo; to such an extent that you’re left with just &ldquo;programming.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="use-evidence-whose-veracity-can-not-be-challenged">Use Evidence Whose Veracity Can Not Be Challenged</h2>
<p>The software development community has a very low evidentiary standard – somewhere approaching zero. In other words, personal observations and testimonials are the only corroboration that most will require for any statement you might make. Empirical software engineering is not a popular field and the task of gathering empirical data sounds altogether like too much hard work for most to be bothered with it. All the numbers and statistics that it generates make really boring reading.</p>
<p>Additionally, it takes time to conduct experiments, and who has that sort of time when you’re busy &ldquo;riding the wave&rdquo; of the latest technology fad?</p>
<p>These factors are a gift to you, the burgeoning XP orator. With suitably contrived &ldquo;anecdotal evidence&rdquo; you can justify any claim you might make, no matter how preposterous. Whether such evidence has any basis in fact is almost entirely irrelevant. Anecdotal evidence is qualitative in nature, which lends itself readily to exaggeration and confabulation. You can create anecdotal statistics, safe in the knowledge that nobody has any better information with which to challenge you. Here’s an example from Robert Martin:</p>
<p>We find that only one in twenty programmers dislike pairing so much that they refuse to continue after trying it. About one in ten programmers start out being strongly resistant to the idea, but after trying for a couple of weeks about half of them find that pairing helps them.2</p>
<p>If anyone does try to challenge your statistics, just ask them why they are so hung up on numbers, and suggest that an emphasis upon quantification in software development is unreasonable and impractical.</p>
<p>If the purported evidence originates from your own experiences, prefix it with &ldquo;in my experience&rdquo; and claim &ldquo;I’ve seen it with my own eyes.&rdquo; Who could doubt that? If you want evidence to have come from someone else, to create the impression of independence, remember that you can always get the answers you want by asking the right questions of the right people.</p>
<h2 id="create-slogans-and-neologisms">Create Slogans And Neologisms</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever wondered why the XP lexicon contains so many trite catch phrases like &ldquo;embrace change&rdquo; and cutesy terms like &ldquo;planning game&rdquo; and &ldquo;YAGNI&rdquo;, then you’ve hit upon two of the most important features of the vernacular – slogans and neologisms.</p>
<p>Slogans are a frequently used marketing device. They’re like the &ldquo;hook&rdquo; in a pop song – they are music to the ears of the masses. As an added bonus, they lend themselves to being parroted off dogmatically – which will discourage people from thinking (critically or otherwise) about the validity of the propositions they embody. XP slogans are the rhetorical equivalent of the pre-prepared meals that TV cooking show hosts introduce with the phrase &ldquo;here’s one I made earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To get you started, here are a few anti-XP slogans you might like to put on a t-shirt or poster:
• Pairprogramming–forthosewithonlyhalfabrain
• eXtremePropagandanotwelcomehere
• EmbraceChange(You’reGonnaNeedItafteryougetfired) • IfXPIsSoGreatWhyCan’tTheyFindTheSpaceBar?</p>
<p>Neologisms are a trademark of many methodologies. By creating new terms you also create the impression of invention; of having discovered or created something so novel that no existing term adequately describes it. Conveniently then, neologisms allow you to take old knowledge, give it a new name, and then portray it as being something new. What’s more, if you created the term, then you have a monopoly over its definition, which you are free to change from time to time as suits your purpose. You can even furnish common terms like &ldquo;success&rdquo; and &ldquo;simple&rdquo; with methodology-specific definitions, if this is what it takes to preserve the truth of some rather brash statements you made earlier. Do not be hampered by the bug-bear of consistency. Feel free to develop conflicting definitions of terms, giving you the freedom to later invoke whatever definition is most convenient for the situation you’re in. If anyone should highlight your self-contradiction, simply excuse it as evidence of a deeper wisdom that defies even your complete understanding.</p>
<h2 id="a-catechism">A Catechism</h2>
<p>To illustrate how these techniques can be used in combination, I offer you the following dialog that I may or may not have had recently (hey, it&rsquo;s anecdotal evidence – how are you going to challenge me?) with a hard- core XPer. I chose to abandon my usual skeptical mode of argument and get &ldquo;down and dirty&rdquo; with some XP lingo. I encourage you to try it sometime. It’s quite liberating to be free of the constraints of logic, and the burden of proof.</p>
<p>XPer Hey Ed, want to do some pair programming with me?
Ed: No thanks - pair programming isn’t for me.
XPer: Have you tried it?
Ed: Briefly, but I disliked it - which wasn’t surprising. It’s quite at
odds with my personality.
XPer: How long did you try it for?
Ed: Oh - about four days or so
XPer: (laughing) That&rsquo;s not nearly long enough. And you’ve got to
make sure you&rsquo;re doing it right, otherwise it won&rsquo;t work.
Ed: No &hellip; really. No amount of persistence is going to change the situation. I know enough about my own nature to say that with
some confidence.
XPer: But why not try it again? What are you afraid of?
Ed: [switching to XP lingo] I&rsquo;m afraid of ending up in a state of total
cognitive surrender, like yourself and other similarly disillusioned XP zealots. Anyway – why do you need to program with someone else? Aren&rsquo;t you good enough to work by yourself?
XPer: :[taken aback] It&rsquo;s not about &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s about &ldquo;better&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m more productive when I work with someone else.
Ed: So you claim. If I claimed to be more productive with a whiskey and soda by my side, would that warrant charging up a bottle of Jack Daniels to the project? Playing around with novel work methods at the customer&rsquo;s expense is professionally irresponsible.
XPer: But pair programming works! I&rsquo;ve experienced it for myself!
Ed: No, what you&rsquo;ve experienced is having a nice time with a buddy. Then you justified it to yourself by claiming a productivity
improvement. People see what they want to see.
XPer: I don&rsquo;t think you can comment – you haven&rsquo;t really tried pair
programming
Ed: Or to put it another way – I&rsquo;m not the slave to technical fashion
that you are – which actually gives me a more objective viewpoint from which to comment. Pair programming is a fantasy - there is simply no evidence that it works. Those who think it does are kidding themselves.
XPer: How can you say that? There was this university study that demonstrated experimentally that it works!
Ed: Are you talking about the study by Laurie Williams at the University of Utah?
XPer: Yeah – that&rsquo;s the one.
Ed: Tell me – have you read William&rsquo;s thesis?</p>
<p>XPer: Ed:
XPer: Ed:
XPer: Ed:
XPer:
Ed: XPer: E:
XPer Ed:
XPer: XPer:
XPer:</p>
<p>Well – no, but I&rsquo;ve read about it.
So I can&rsquo;t comment on pair programming because I haven’t really tried it, but you can comment on experiments that you haven&rsquo;t even read
Look – I may not have read the details, but I know what it proved.
What it proved is that it&rsquo;s easy to do bad experiments, and that many software developers like yourself are gullible enough to believe anything they hear, so long as it fits in with their preconceptions. If you really knew about pair programming, you&rsquo;d already know that the Williams experiment proves absolutely nothing.
I&rsquo;ve paired with plenty of developers in the past, but nobody got upset about it like you. Have you got some kind of problem?
If you think that others should necessarily have the same preferences as you, then I’d suggest it’s you that’s got the problem. I&rsquo;m happy for you to pair program if you want, but I must decline the offer to participate in your hallucination. [shaking head] Ed, you&rsquo;ve got to learn to &ldquo;embrace change&rdquo;. The whole XP thing is taking off – &ldquo;agile&rdquo; is the way software development is gonna be from now on. Get on board or step aside.
&ldquo;Change imposed is changed opposed.&rdquo;
How do you mean?
For one so agile, you’re a bit slow on the pick-up. In this context, it means that if you try and force people to work a way they don’t want to, then they&rsquo;ll fight back.
I don&rsquo;t hear anyone fighting against XP.
Then where have you been for the last five minutes? You just demonstrated my point – people hear what they want to hear.
Ok, maybe some folks don’t get it, but there are plenty of people who do, and who are achieving success.
At least as many people have tried XP and failed. Some of them go on to claim success anyway, because admitting to failure would be too embarrassing. Most of them just say nothing and hope nobody notices their stuff-up. If you think the success- stories you read about in the media are representative, you’re kidding yourself. The real story is very, very different. &ldquo;Success has many fathers, but failure is an orphan.&rdquo;
OK, maybe there&rsquo;s some truth to that. But you can’t be saying that all these XP proponents are lying?
Ed: No – not all of them, but some of them are, and some of them are
exaggerating. The rest are probably what we call &ldquo;pious frauds&rdquo; - that is, they genuinely believe what they’re saying, but are really misconstruing the influence of XP on their projects. It&rsquo;s easy to do if you play down the negatives and emphasize the positives.
XPer: Say – didn&rsquo;t you tell me once that you&rsquo;re a skeptic? Shouldn&rsquo;t a skeptic keep an open mind?
Ed: Yes, but not so open that their brains fall out.</p>
