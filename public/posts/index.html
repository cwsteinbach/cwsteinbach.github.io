      There is a realization that comes with the accrual of software development experience across a reasonable number of organizations, and it is this: Though the names change, the problems remain the same.
Traveling from project to project, from one organization to another, across disparate geographies, domains and technologies, I am repeatedly struck more by the similarities between the projects I work on than their differences. Scenes from one job seem to replay in the next one, only with a different set of actors.

      The term &ldquo;user&rdquo; is not just a pronoun, it is a powerful buzzword that pervades the software development literature, to both good and bad effect. On the up side, the development community has been made aware of the dominating role that end user experience plays in determining the success or failure of many projects. On the down side, the message of the importance of user feedback to the development process has been adopted by some with uncritical fervor.

      The Mars Polar Lander (MPL) that NASA launched in 1999 is now a rather attractive and very expensive field of tinsel-like shrapnel scattered over several square kilometers of the Martian surface. It is not functional in any capacity. It is no more. It has ceased to be.
Its demise was the result of the flight control software incorrectly answering the question that car-bound children have been plaguing their parents with for years – &ldquo;are we there yet?

      Perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen the Dilbert comic about Process Girl. At a meeting, the Pointy Haired Boss introduces Process Girl as &ldquo;the one who has the answer to everything&rdquo;, at which point Process Girl chimes in parrot-like with &ldquo;Process!&rdquo; She then denounces the meeting as inefficient because the participants have no process to describe how to conduct a meeting. By a unanimous vote she is expelled from the meeting. As he escorts her out of the room, Dilbert offers by way of consolation &ldquo;at least you lasted longer than Quality Guy.

      The word &ldquo;argument&rdquo; has negative connotations for many people. It is associated with heated exchanges and passionate disagreement. But your experience of argument need not be so negative. Consider that the word &lsquo;argument&rsquo; also means &lsquo;a line of reasoning&rsquo;. By approaching a verbal or electronic discussion, even a hostile one, with this definition in mind, you can learn to separate the logical content of the exchange from its emotional content and thereby deal with each more effectively.

      Recently I have had the misfortune to be playing the interview circuit again; parading from one interrogation to the next like some prisoner of technical war. The experience has been both frustrating and humiliating – and unpleasant reminder of how appallingly most technical interviews are conducted.
So ignorant is the conduct of many interviewers, one could be forgiven for thinking they have undertaken the interview process with the deliberate intent of minimizing the chances of finding the right person for the job, and maximizing the opportunity for their own ego gratification.

In some interviews there comes a point where you realize that you don&rsquo;t want the job. It might be the moment you discover that the employer has conveniently omitted from the published job description the requirement for the incumbent to spend 50% of their time maintaining a one million line legacy application, written in Visual Basic.

      External observers often think of programmers as being somewhat cold and emotionless. Because our day-to-day activities are largely analytical in nature, it has become a part of the developer stereotype that we are dispassionate and rational in our manner and decision making. Those who have watched programmers up close for any length of time will know that this is far from the case. I believe that emotion plays a far larger part in IT decision making than many would be willing to admit.
