Numerology is the study of the occult meanings of numbers and their influence on human life1. Numerologists specialize in finding numeric relationships between otherwise disparate figures, and attributing to them some greater significance.
For instance, some claim that by adding up the component numbers in your birth date, together with the numeric equivalent of your name (where A=1, B=2 etc) then a figure is derived that, if properly interpreted, can yield insight into your personality.

      As software developers we place a lot of emphasis upon our own experiences. This is natural enough, given that we have no agreed upon body of knowledge to which we might turn to resolve disputes or inform our opinions. Nor do we have the benefit of empirical investigation and experiment to serve as the ultimate arbiter of truth, as is the case for the sciences and other branches of engineering - in part because of the infancy of Empirical Software Engineering as a field of study; in part because of the difficulty of conducting controlled experiments in our domain.

      Vague Propositions A term is called “vague” if it has a clear meaning but not a clearly demarcated scope. Many arguments on Usenet groups and forums stem from the combatants having different interpretations of a vaguely stated proposition. To avoid this sort of misunderstanding, before exploring the truth of a given proposition either rhetorically or empirically, you should first state that proposition as precisely as possible.
Consider this proposition: P(1): Pair Programming works If I were to voice that proposition on the Yahoo XP group1, I would expect it to receive enthusiastic endorsement.

      Argumentation cannot suffice for the discovery of new work, since the subtlety of Nature is greater many times than the subtlety of argument. &ndash; Fracis Bacon
The over-enthusiastic and often uncritical adoption of XP and Agile tenets by many in the software development community is worrying.
It is worrying because it attests to the willingness of many developers to accept claims made on the basis of argument and rhetoric alone.

      I recently began work on a J2EE project – a workflow assistance tool that has been under development for a few years. The application is totally new to me and yet is immediately familiar, for it bears the scars and wounds so common to a legacy system. Browsing through the code base and playing with the GUI, the half dozen legacy code anti-patterns that leave me with déjà vu are listed below.

      I just had a new ISDN phone line installed at my house. It was an unexpectedly entertaining event, and provided the opportunity for some reflection on the similarity between the problems faced by software developers and those in other occupations.
The installation was performed by a technician who introduced himself in a Yugoslavian brogue as &ldquo;Ranko.&rdquo; Ranko looked at the existing phone outlets, declared that it would be a straight forward job and should take 30 - 45 minutes.

      “An interactive debugger is an outstanding example of what is not needed – it encourages trial-and-error hacking rather than systematic design, and also hides marginal people barely qualified for precision programming.”– Harlan Mills
Recently, a colleague and I were working together to resolve a bug in a piece of code she had just written. The bug resulted in an exception being thrown and looking at the stack trace, we were both puzzled about what the root cause might be.

      If you are about to undertake a major project using SWT, I suggest you think very carefully before doing so. Compared to its obvious competitor, Swing, SWT is very lacking in functionality, support and community development experience. Little wonder that there is not a lot of detailed information to be found from people who are using SWT in anger to create serious applications. There is a certain amount of fan-boy stuff1, written by people in the first blush of initial enthusiasm, convinced that everything is &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and &ldquo;awesome&rdquo;, but very little from people who have been through a significant implementation effort extending over months or years.

      If you&rsquo;re like me, you approach the subject of accessibility with a certain self-conscious guilt. On the one hand, you recognize that there are excellent ethical and legal reasons for making your applications – be they web-based or rich client – accessible to those with sensory or cognitive impairments; but on the other hand you can&rsquo;t ignore the fact that the extra work required to add that accessibility is only going to make a difference to a very small percentage of your users.

      I have a woeful sense of direction — the navigational abilities of a lemming combined with the homing instinct of a drunk. But like much of my gender, I continue to entertain the fantasy that I possess an instinctive ability to find my way, an evolutionary artifact of the male&rsquo;s traditional role as the hunter; an unerring inner compass that will guide me safely through the hunt of everyday life, despite voluminous evidence to the contrary.
