      Over the past few years, I’ve spent more time in consideration of XP and its followers than is in the best interests of one’s mental health. My pre-occupation with it springs from my broader interest in skepticism. It’s fascinating to watch the same forces that drive cults, pseudo-science and other popular delusions at work in one’s own profession. It’s like driving past a road accident. It’s tragic and disturbing, but so entrancing that you just can’t look away.

      I first encountered the coincidence of the aesthetic and the technical in a secondary school mathematics class. After leading the class through an algebraic proof, my teacher said &ldquo;You have to admit there&rsquo;s a certain beauty to that.&rdquo; As I recall, he was met by a room of blank stares, one of which was my own. I remember thinking &ldquo;You sad, sad man.&rdquo; I really couldn’t see how a mathematical proof could be called &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;.

      In recent weeks I’ve read two books by cult survivors. The first, &ldquo;Inside Out” by Alexandra Stein1, describes her ten year embroilment in a Minneapolis political cult called “The O.” The second, &ldquo;Seductive Poison&rdquo; by Deborah Layton2, details the author’s involvement with the “Peoples Temple,” the religious cult lead by Jim Jones, who engineered the mass suicide of 900 of his followers in 1978.
Reading each I became aware of the similarities in the methods for control, manipulation and persuasion that both cults employed.

      The software development arena is the land of the perpetual &ldquo;me too.&rdquo; Populated by an eager community of &ldquo;joiners,&rdquo; every band wagon that comes along is soon laden down by a collection of hype merchants who, recognizing the next big thing when they see it, are keen to milk it for all it is worth. Extreme Programming – that marketing campaign in search of a product – was a particularly fruitful source of commercial spin-offs.

      Software developers are drawn to metrics for a variety of reasons. Generally, their motivations are good. They want to find out something meaningful about the way their project is progressing or the way they are doing their job. Managers are also drawn to metrication for a variety of reasons, but their motives are not necessarily honorable. Some managers view metrics as an instrument for getting more work out of their team and detecting if they are slacking off.

      An organizational antipattern that I have seen a few times now is the formation of an Architecture Group. Architecture Groups generally have the following purposes: • Todesigntheenterprisearchitecturesharedbyagroupofapplications within an organization • Toreviewthedesignofprojectstoensuretheyareconsistentwiththe enterprise architecture • Toprescribethestandardtechnologiestobeusedacrossprojectsinthe organization In summary, the Architecture Group is an internal &ldquo;governing body&rdquo; and &ldquo;standards group&rdquo; rolled into one. Membership of the group tends to be restricted by seniority – the architects and senior technical staff.

      “If you are a good leader who talks little, they will say when your work is done and your aim fulfilled, ‘We did it ourselves.’” – Lao-Tse, cited in 1
Perhaps the most difficult job to do on any software development project is that of Technical Lead. The Technical Lead has overall responsibility for all technical aspects of the project – design, code, technology selection, work assignment, scheduling and architecture are all within his purview.

      Many of us use the terms &ldquo;programmer&rdquo; and &ldquo;developer&rdquo; interchangeably. When someone asks me what I do for a living I tend to describe my vocation as &ldquo;computer programmer&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;software developer&rdquo;, because the former seems to be understood more readily by those unfamiliar with IT. Even when writing pieces for this site, I tend to swap back and forth between the two terms, to try and avoid sounding repetitive.

        Corporate Pimps: Dealing With Technical Recruiters

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Anyone who has had any substantial dealings with technical recruiters invariably has a poor opinion of them. This is because the standard of practice in the recruiting industry is so low. To be a recruiter you don’t need any formal qualification, or any particular experience.
Recruiting, as it is generally practiced, is little more than telemarketing. As with telemarketing, people are drawn to it because of the opportunity to make money without having to satisfy any particular educational requirements.

      There are real advantages to having a group of people, separate from developers, whose job is solely to find fault with your work. They have an emotional and cognitive distance from the product that a developer can never fully imitate. Testing is a task requiring patience, attention to detail and a fairly devious mindset. Sometimes managers make the mistake of regarding testing as a second class activity, suitable to be performed by less skilled or more junior staff members.
