      The word &ldquo;argument&rdquo; has negative connotations for many people. It is associated with heated exchanges and passionate disagreement. But your experience of argument need not be so negative. Consider that the word &lsquo;argument&rsquo; also means &lsquo;a line of reasoning&rsquo;. By approaching a verbal or electronic discussion, even a hostile one, with this definition in mind, you can learn to separate the logical content of the exchange from its emotional content and thereby deal with each more effectively.

      Recently I have had the misfortune to be playing the interview circuit again; parading from one interrogation to the next like some prisoner of technical war. The experience has been both frustrating and humiliating – and unpleasant reminder of how appallingly most technical interviews are conducted.
So ignorant is the conduct of many interviewers, one could be forgiven for thinking they have undertaken the interview process with the deliberate intent of minimizing the chances of finding the right person for the job, and maximizing the opportunity for their own ego gratification.

      “All men&rsquo;s miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.” – Blaise Pascal
In some interviews there comes a point where you realize that you don&rsquo;t want the job. It might be the moment you discover that the employer has conveniently omitted from the published job description the requirement for the incumbent to spend 50% of their time maintaining a one million line legacy application, written in Visual Basic.

      External observers often think of programmers as being somewhat cold and emotionless. Because our day-to-day activities are largely analytical in nature, it has become a part of the developer stereotype that we are dispassionate and rational in our manner and decision making. Those who have watched programmers up close for any length of time will know that this is far from the case. I believe that emotion plays a far larger part in IT decision making than many would be willing to admit.

      Perhaps you&rsquo;ve seen the Dilbert comic about Process Girl. At a meeting, the Pointy Haired Boss introduces Process Girl as &ldquo;the one who has the answer to everything&rdquo;, at which point Process Girl chimes in parrot-like with &ldquo;Process!&rdquo; She then denounces the meeting as inefficient because the participants have no process to describe how to conduct a meeting. By a unanimous vote she is expelled from the meeting. As he escorts her out of the room, Dilbert offers by way of consolation &ldquo;at least you lasted longer than Quality Guy.

      There is a realization that comes with the accrual of software development experience across a reasonable number of organizations, and it is this: Though the names change, the problems remain the same.
Traveling from project to project, from one organization to another, across disparate geographies, domains and technologies, I am repeatedly struck more by the similarities between the projects I work on than their differences. Scenes from one job seem to replay in the next one, only with a different set of actors.

      Hacknot began life in 2001 as an internal mailing list at the multinational telecommunications company I was then working for. As part of the activities of the local Software Engineering Process Group, I was looking for a way to promote discussion amongst staff about software engineering related issues, and to hopefully encourage people to learn about the methods and techniques that could be used to improve the quality of their work.
