      The selection of good class names is critical to the maintainability of your application. They form the basic vocabulary in which developers speak and the language in which they describe the code&rsquo;s every activity. No wonder then that vague or misleading class names will quickly derail your best efforts to understand the code base.
Because we are called on to invent class names so frequently, there is a tendency to become somewhat lackadaisical in our approach.

      Recently I&rsquo;ve been instituting a code review process on a number of projects in my workplace. To kick start use of the process, I took a sample of the Java code written by each of my colleagues and reviewed it.
While doing so I was struck by the degree of individual variation in the use of Javadoc comments, and reminded of how easy it is to fulfill one&rsquo;s obligation to provide Javadoc without really thinking about how effectively one is actually communicating.

      &ldquo;Think twice, cut once&rdquo; - Carpenter&rsquo;s adage
In the years that I&rsquo;ve been doing software development, the one source of recurring dispute between myself and colleagues is the issue of design documentation. I am of the opinion that the production and review of design documentation significantly increases the chances of producing quality software, and that such documentation should be an integral part of the development of any piece of commercial software.

      The Agile Manifesto1 states: &ldquo;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.&rdquo;
Forgive me for questioning a holy proclamation, but isn&rsquo;t it rather well established that verbal communication is often incomplete and ambiguous, and that human memory is inaccurate and prone to confabulation? The plethora of psychological research in such areas as false memories, the veracity of eyewitness testimony, and the effect of predisposition on the interpretation of sensory data has surely given us a big hint that our perceptual and communicative capabilities are erratic and dubitable?

      “You know you&rsquo;ve achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupery
Much is spoken of &ldquo;good design&rdquo; in the software world. It is what we all aim for when we start a project, and what we hope we still have when we walk away from the project. But how do we assess the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a given design?

        The Folly of Emergent Design

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      One of the most pernicious ideas to proceed from the current focus on lightweight methodologies is that of Emergent Design. It&rsquo;s difficult to find a precise description of emergent design – most discussion on the subject carefully avoids committing to any particular definition. One of the most succinct descriptions I&rsquo;ve encountered is this, from the adaptionsoft web site:
&ldquo;Many systems eventually require drastic changes. You cannot anticipate them all, so stop trying to anticipate any of them.

      The term &ldquo;user&rdquo; is not just a pronoun, it is a powerful buzzword that pervades the software development literature, to both good and bad effect. On the up side, the development community has been made aware of the dominating role that end user experience plays in determining the success or failure of many projects. On the down side, the message of the importance of user feedback to the development process has been adopted by some with uncritical fervor.

      The Mars Polar Lander (MPL) that NASA launched in 1999 is now a rather attractive and very expensive field of tinsel-like shrapnel scattered over several square kilometers of the Martian surface. It is not functional in any capacity. It is no more. It has ceased to be.
Its demise was the result of the flight control software incorrectly answering the question that car-bound children have been plaguing their parents with for years – &ldquo;are we there yet?

      For a brief, shining moment there was hope. Through the exaggeration and braggadocio that so permeates the conversation of the Agile community, there came a fleeting glimpse of self-awareness – a flash of social perspective that could have precipitated a greater moderation and rationality in the methodological discourse. And then it was gone – swept aside by the force of yet another ill-considered generalization.
I’m referring to a recent blog entry by Martin Fowler entitled AppealToAuthority.

      In your readings of the voluminous XP canon, you will no doubt have encountered mention of the practice of Pair Programming1. If, like me, you are of a solitary disposition, you will have found yourself thinking – nice idea, but not for me.
Many of us are attracted to software development as a career because we enjoy the experience of solitary problem solving. We relish those times when we are &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; – where our locus of concern narrows to exclude everything but ourselves, the keyboard and the problem at hand.
