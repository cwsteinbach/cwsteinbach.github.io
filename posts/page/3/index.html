      The Agile Manifesto1 states: &ldquo;The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.&rdquo;
Forgive me for questioning a holy proclamation, but isn&rsquo;t it rather well established that verbal communication is often incomplete and ambiguous, and that human memory is inaccurate and prone to confabulation? The plethora of psychological research in such areas as false memories, the veracity of eyewitness testimony, and the effect of predisposition on the interpretation of sensory data has surely given us a big hint that our perceptual and communicative capabilities are erratic and dubitable?

      “You know you&rsquo;ve achieved perfection in design, not when you have nothing more to add, but when you have nothing more to take away.” – Antoine de Saint-Exupery
Much is spoken of &ldquo;good design&rdquo; in the software world. It is what we all aim for when we start a project, and what we hope we still have when we walk away from the project. But how do we assess the &ldquo;goodness&rdquo; of a given design?

      One of the most pernicious ideas to proceed from the current focus on lightweight methodologies is that of Emergent Design. It&rsquo;s difficult to find a precise description of emergent design – most discussion on the subject carefully avoids committing to any particular definition. One of the most succinct descriptions I&rsquo;ve encountered is this, from the adaptionsoft web site:
&ldquo;Many systems eventually require drastic changes. You cannot anticipate them all, so stop trying to anticipate any of them.

      The term &ldquo;user&rdquo; is not just a pronoun, it is a powerful buzzword that pervades the software development literature, to both good and bad effect. On the up side, the development community has been made aware of the dominating role that end user experience plays in determining the success or failure of many projects. On the down side, the message of the importance of user feedback to the development process has been adopted by some with uncritical fervor.

      The Mars Polar Lander (MPL) that NASA launched in 1999 is now a rather attractive and very expensive field of tinsel-like shrapnel scattered over several square kilometers of the Martian surface. It is not functional in any capacity. It is no more. It has ceased to be.
Its demise was the result of the flight control software incorrectly answering the question that car-bound children have been plaguing their parents with for years – &ldquo;are we there yet?

      For a brief, shining moment there was hope. Through the exaggeration and braggadocio that so permeates the conversation of the Agile community, there came a fleeting glimpse of self-awareness – a flash of social perspective that could have precipitated a greater moderation and rationality in the methodological discourse. And then it was gone – swept aside by the force of yet another ill-considered generalization.
I’m referring to a recent blog entry by Martin Fowler entitled AppealToAuthority.

People have a vast capacity for self-deception. Even members of the scientific community, from whom we expect objectivity, can unwittingly allow their personal beliefs and preconceptions to color their interpretation of data. Professional ambition and wishful thinking can turn their stance from one of neutral observance into passionate adherence to a position, sustained by willful ignorance of contrary evidence.

      In your readings of the voluminous XP canon, you will no doubt have encountered mention of the practice of Pair Programming1. If, like me, you are of a solitary disposition, you will have found yourself thinking – nice idea, but not for me.
Many of us are attracted to software development as a career because we enjoy the experience of solitary problem solving. We relish those times when we are &ldquo;in the zone&rdquo; – where our locus of concern narrows to exclude everything but ourselves, the keyboard and the problem at hand.

      Over the past few years, I’ve spent more time in consideration of XP and its followers than is in the best interests of one’s mental health. My pre-occupation with it springs from my broader interest in skepticism. It’s fascinating to watch the same forces that drive cults, pseudo-science and other popular delusions at work in one’s own profession. It’s like driving past a road accident. It’s tragic and disturbing, but so entrancing that you just can’t look away.

      I first encountered the coincidence of the aesthetic and the technical in a secondary school mathematics class. After leading the class through an algebraic proof, my teacher said &ldquo;You have to admit there&rsquo;s a certain beauty to that.&rdquo; As I recall, he was met by a room of blank stares, one of which was my own. I remember thinking &ldquo;You sad, sad man.&rdquo; I really couldn’t see how a mathematical proof could be called &ldquo;beautiful&rdquo;.
