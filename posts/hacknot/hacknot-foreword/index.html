    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Hacknot began life in 2001 as an internal mailing list at the multinational
telecommunications company I was then working for. As part of the activities of
the local Software Engineering Process Group, I was looking for a way to promote
discussion amongst staff about software engineering related issues, and to
hopefully encourage people to learn about the methods and techniques that could
be used to improve the quality of their work. A creative colleague came up with
the name “Hacknot” for the mailing list &hellip; a pun on the geek web site
“slashdot.”</p>
<p>A few years later, when I left the company, I restarted Hacknot as an externally
hosted mailing list, with many of the same members as in its last incarnation.
In 2003, I was looking for a coding exercise in J2EE, the main technologies of
which had passed me by while I was busy working in other areas. Growing tired of
building play-applications like bug trackers and online store simulations, I
decided to create a web version of the Hacknot mailing list. I figured it would
give me a “real world” context in which to learn about J2EE, and also a project
that I could pursue without the interference of the usually inept management
that so plagued the development efforts of my working life.</p>
<p>So in 2003 the Hacknot web site was born. In Australia, domain name registration
rules restrict ownership of “.com” domains to commercial
enterprises, so I chose the next best top-level domain, which was
“.info”.</p>
<p>Initially, I imagined that the web site would host works by a variety of
authors, myself included. But when it came time to put pen to paper, almost all
of those who had previously expressed interest in participating suddenly backed
off, leaving me to write all the content myself.</p>
<p>Many of the essays on Hacknot take a stab at some sacred cow of the software
development field, such as Extreme Programming, Open Source and Function Point
Analysis. These subjects tend to attract fanatical adherents who
don’t take kindly to someone criticizing what for them has become an
object of veneration. The vitriol of some of the e-mail I receive is testament
to the fact that some people need to get out more and get a sense of
perspective. It is partially because of the controversial nature of these topics
that I have always written behind a pseudonym; either
“Ed”, “Mr. Ed” or “Ed
Johnson”. I also favor anonymity because it makes a nice change from
the relentless self-promotion engaged in by so many members of the IT community.</p>
<h2 id="the-hacknot-book">The Hacknot Book</h2>
<p>This book contains 46 essays originally published on the Hacknot web site
between 2003 and 2006. The version of each essay appearing in the book is
substantially the same as the online version, with some minor revisions and
editing.</p>
<p>You can freely download copies of this book in PDF format with page sizes of 6”
