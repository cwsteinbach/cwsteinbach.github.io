    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>I am frequently frustrated and disappointed in the standard of management I am
subject to. Discussions with my peers in the software industry lead me to
believe that I am not alone in my malaise. So on behalf of the silent multitude
of software professionals who are disappointed with their management, I would
like to remind you - the project manager, team leader or technical manager - of
those basic rights to which your staff are entitled.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-your-courtesy-and-respect">The Right To Your Courtesy And Respect</h2>
<p>Of the complaints I hear directed towards management, the most frequent concern
dishonest, abusive or otherwise inappropriate behavior. Remember that no matter
how angry or frustrated you may be feeling, it is never okay to direct that
anger towards your associates. Intemperate outbursts only engender disrespect
and generate ill feeling. As a leader, you are obliged to behave in an exemplary
manner at all times.</p>
<p>Respecting your staff implies valuing their opinions, and being prepared to
accept their determinations in areas where their expertise is greater than your
own. It means acknowledging and accommodating the technical obstacles they
encounter, rather than trying to usurp reality with authority.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-adequate-resources">The Right To Adequate Resources</h2>
<p>Skimping on software and hardware resources is an obviously false economy, as a
deficit of either impedes your most expensive resource – your people.</p>
<p>More commonly overlooked are such environmental resources as lighting, storage
space, desk space, ergonomic aids and whiteboards. Workers quickly become
dissatisfied if the basic elements of a productive environment are absent.</p>
<p>The resource generally in shortest supply in a software development environment
is time. It’s not surprising then that unrealistic scheduling is one
of the greatest sources of conflict between technical staff and their
management. Please keep this in mind - successful scheduling is a process of
negotiation, not dictation.</p>
<p>Nobody knows more about how long a particular task will take to complete than
the person who is to complete it. Your team has the right to be consulted on the
scheduling of those tasks they are responsible for, and to be able to meet their
commitments without undue stress or hardship.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-emotional-safety">The Right To Emotional Safety</h2>
<p>In many corporate cultures there is a stigma associated with being the bearer of
bad news. To ensure that individuals feel safe in expressing unpopular truths,
you must not only accept, but also welcome bad news as an opportunity to avert a
more serious problem later. Ultimately, you are reliant upon others to keep you
apprised of the project’s technical progress, so it is obviously
beneficial to obtain their insights in uncensored form. For their part,
technical staff need to feel that they can openly seek help with their problems,
without risk of punitive repercussions.</p>
<p>In a human-based endeavor like software development, mistakes and failures are
inevitable. Staff rightfully expects a compassionate attitude from you when
dealing with their own failures. When they underestimate a task’s
completion time, or inject a defect into the code base, they need help in
correcting the underlying problem, not castigation for the symptom.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-your-support">The Right To Your Support</h2>
<p>Your staff has the right to expect your assistance in dealing with the issues
they encounter. Responsiveness is paramount - issues need to be dealt with in a
timely manner, before they can fester into full-blown crises. You must be
willing to put aside self-regard and do whatever is necessary to resolve the
issue as quickly as possible. This may mean making an unpopular decision, or
entering into conflict with other managers. Without the courage and integrity to
support your team in this manner, you compromise the well being of the project
and the people on it.</p>
<p>Failure to proactively support your team’s efforts will necessarily
disadvantage them. They have a right to presume you will use your experience and
your high level view of the project to forecast the risks they may encounter,
and prepare mitigation strategies accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-know">The Right To Know</h2>
<p>Your team expects decisions affecting project staffing, scheduling and scope to
be communicated to them quickly and honestly. Unnecessary delays can limit their
ability to respond effectively to changing conditions, with consequent stress
and time pressure.</p>
<p>Some managers feel they have to shield their subordinates from the political
machinations of their organization. This attitude betrays little respect for
their team member’s maturity, and a basic ignorance of the technical
personality, which values painful truths over comforting lies. Your staff has
the right to know about anything that impacts on their work, so that they can
maximize the chances of achieving their goals.</p>
<h2 id="the-right-to-self-determination">The Right To Self-Determination</h2>
<p>There is nothing so disempowering as to be set goals, but have no control over
the means by which one is to achieve them. This is the predicament in which you
place your staff if you deny them the flexibility to tailor their work practices
to the problem at hand, insisting instead on rigid adherence to methodological
or corporate dogma. You may find political safety in playing it by the book, but
your people want to work in a way that makes best use of their time and energy,
and expect your support in achieving that goal.</p>
<p>It is my recurring observation that management practices that infringe upon the
abovementioned rights are common. Equally common is the software
professional’s lamentation that their management &ldquo;doesn’t
have a clue.&rdquo; The two may well be causally related.</p>
<p>So I urge you to put aside your spreadsheets and Gantt charts for a moment and
consider the rights of your subordinates. Focus on the basic principles of a
humane management style - integrity, respect, courtesy and compassion. Their
application cannot guarantee your success as a manager, but their absence will
guarantee your failure.</p>
