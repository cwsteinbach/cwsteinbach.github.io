alone.” – Blaise Pascal</p>
<p>In some interviews there comes a point where you realize that you don&rsquo;t want the
job. It might be the moment you discover that the employer has conveniently
omitted from the published job description the requirement for the incumbent to
spend 50% of their time maintaining a one million line legacy application,
written in Visual Basic. It may be shortly after you state your salary
expectation, only to be greeted with a look of blank astonishment. For me, it is
often the point at which the interviewer reaches into their bag of interview
clichés and asks a question so trite that it betrays the total absence of
advance preparation and original thought. Once the role has been safely
relegated to the &ldquo;no thanks&rdquo; pile, it is difficult to resist adopting a certain
playfulness while waiting out the duration of the interview, as courtesy
demands.</p>
<p>For example, when asked &ldquo;Where do you see yourself in five years time?&rdquo; I like
to borrow a witticism from comedian Steven Wright, and respond &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
– I don&rsquo;t have any special powers like that.&rdquo; If asked &ldquo;Why are
manhole covers round?&rdquo; I might reply &ldquo;Because God made them that way&rdquo;, simply to
see if they will dare broach a topic traditionally considered taboo in
interviews. And if they should enquire &ldquo;What are your career goals?&rdquo; I will
almost certainly reply &ldquo;I have only one – I want a door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in this last I&rsquo;m only partially being facetious, for one of the most
consistently difficult aspects of every software development effort I&rsquo;ve been a
part of has been the physical environment in which it is conducted. Having
abandoned the lofty career goals of my youth (such as producing quality
software) I have deliberately set my sights a little lower. These days, my sole
ambition is to have an office with a door. My professional nirvana would then be
to close that door, so I can get on with my work undisturbed.</p>
<p>As challenging as technical issues can be, they are at least considered
approachable by most organizations. But environmental problems, particularly
noise levels, seem to universally receive short shrift, and are often dismissed
as an unfortunate but unavoidable part of office life and beyond anyone&rsquo;s
ability to deal with.</p>
<p>Of course, the problem of office noise is far from intractable. Numerous
approaches can be taken to relieve or at least ameliorate the problem, the most
obvious of which involves the reintroduction of an antiquated and long neglected
piece of spatial division technology – the door. The real reasons
that environmental issues go unattended are somewhat different.</p>
<h2 id="brain-time-versus-body-time">Brain Time Versus Body Time</h2>
<p>Software developers are knowledge workers. Our job is to produce intellectual
property. You would think it self-evident that work of this nature requires
sustained concentration, and that it is easier to concentrate when things are
quiet.</p>
<p>Back in my school days, these facts seemed to be widely known and accepted. When
you went to the library, the school librarian (who, in my school, was a
particularly ferocious woman the students referred to as &ldquo;Conan The Librarian&rdquo;)
would do her best to see that the library was quiet. Why? Because people were
trying to study, to think, to concentrate. When there was an exam to be done,
the exam would be conducted in complete silence. Why? Because it&rsquo;s easier to
concentrate on your exam when it&rsquo;s quiet. When the teacher gave the class time
to work on an assignment, the class was expected to be silent. Why? Because it&rsquo;s
easier to think about your assignment when it&rsquo;s quiet.</p>
<p>In university too, there was little dispute about the necessity for a quiet
environment when doing intellectual work. The libraries and exam halls are
silent, the lecture theaters and tutorial rooms are quiet so that the speaker
may be heard and their message understood.</p>
<p>Prior to entering the workforce, I thought nothing of it. It all seemed to be
just common sense. Imagine my surprise then to discover that the corporate world
had decided that none of it was true. That, in fact, you don&rsquo;t need quiet in
order to concentrate effectively – you can work just as well when
immersed in an environment that is a noisy as your local shopping center. Or so
I infer is the reasoning, because the standards in both office accommodation and
behavior seem to have been determined with such an assumption in mind.</p>
<p>Sitting at my desk at work, I am surrounded by distraction and diversion, which
everyone just seems to accept will not impair my ability to work at all. But my
own impression is very much to the contrary. I find myself constantly frustrated
and annoyed by the ceaseless chatter around me and the incessant whir of
printers and photocopiers. I have never known a workplace to be any different.</p>
<p>How is it that the corporate and academic worlds seem to have completely
different ideas about what characterizes an environment conducive to
intellectual activity? Why is it that the academic community seems to have got
it right, and the corporate community ubiquitously has it wrong? Surely
employers are not knowingly paying their staff to be only semi-productive, are
they? Unless the corporate world is consistently behaving in a self-defeating
and irrational way, I must simply be mistaken about the effect this office noise
is having on me.</p>
<p>Perhaps I am actually quite unaffected by the conversations that my cubicle
neighbors are having, on matters unrelated to my work &hellip; all day. Perhaps the
four foot high partition which separates me from them is actually enough to
reduce their inane chatter and laughter to a distant whisper – I
guess the sound dampening cloth on it must have some effect. Although the
partition only covers two of the four sides of my &ldquo;cubicle&rdquo;, perhaps adopting a
&ldquo;glass half full&rdquo; attitude would make the lack of privacy less disturbing.
Perhaps the sound of the printers and copiers in the facilities area, just three
feet away from my desk, really isn&rsquo;t that loud. Perhaps the guy in the next
cubicle who insists on checking his voice mail through the speakerphone isn&rsquo;t
the sociopath he appears to be, and I&rsquo;m just not sufficiently tolerant of
others. Perhaps it&rsquo;s not really all that visually distracting to have people
walking through the corridor beside my cubicle every few minutes. Maybe some
blinkers, like those given to cart horses, would lessen the effect of constant
movement at the periphery of my vision. And perhaps the ten mobile phone calls
that my surrounding cubies seem to get every day, each one heralded by a
distinctive and piercing ring- tone sampled from some Top 10 dance hit, really
isn&rsquo;t as wearing as what I think it is. And maybe having a pair programming
partner leaning over your shoulder, barking in your ear and correcting your
every typographic error isn&rsquo;t an obnoxious novelty that removes what little
remaining chance there is of thoughtful consideration occurring in the modern
workplace, but a mechanism for solving complex problems by having a chat over a
nice cup of tea.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, just perhaps, the cubicle farm is a fundamentally unsuitable work
environment for software developers. But how could that be, when the &ldquo;open plan&rdquo;
office is the corporate norm? Could organizations really be so blind as to
routinely give their staff an environment which is not conducive to the conduct
of their work?</p>
<h2 id="how-could-such-a-patently-irrational-trend-develop-and-persist">How could such a patently irrational trend develop and persist?</h2>
<h3 id="it-s-about-money">It&rsquo;s About Money</h3>
<p>The modern cubicle had its genesis in 1968, when University of Colorado
fine-arts professor Robert Propst came up with the &ldquo;Action Office&rdquo; –
later commercialized by Herman Miller1. At the time, offices usually contained
rows of desks, without any separation between them. At least cubicles were an
improvement. But once the facilities management people cottoned onto the idea of
putting people in boxes, their focus became achieving maximum packing density
and consideration of noise and interruption went out the window (if you could
find one). That mentality persists today, largely because the costs associated
with office accommodation and office space rental are concrete expenditures that
appear on a balance sheet somewhere. Somebody is accountable for those costs,
and therefore seeks to minimize them. But the costs of lost productivity due to
an unsuitable work environment aren&rsquo;t readily quantified, they just disappear
&ldquo;into the air&rdquo;, and so are easily forgotten or disregarded. There are also tax
breaks in some localities, where legislation exists making it quicker to write
off the depreciation of cubicles more quickly than traditional offices.2</p>
<h3 id="it-s-about-rationalization">It&rsquo;s About Rationalization</h3>
<p>The ostensible benefits of an open-plan office are its moderate cost,
flexibility, facilitation of teamwork and efficient use of space. These are the
attributes by which cubicle systems are marketed3. Note that the ability to
create an environment suitable for knowledge workers is not amongst those
features.</p>
<p>Flexibility, although a possibility, is seldom realized in IT-centric
environments where the need to re-route power and network cabling makes people
reticent to re-arrange cubicles to any significant extent. Even individual
variation and customization is discouraged in many workplaces, where such
non-conformity is viewed as a threat to the establishment.</p>
<p>It is also commonly held that cubicles &ldquo;promote communication&rdquo; amongst staff.
Unfortunately, one man&rsquo;s &ldquo;communication&rdquo; is another man&rsquo;s &ldquo;distraction&rdquo;, the
difference being whether the desire to participate is mutual. Alistair Cockburn,
never one stuck for a metaphor, describes the wafting of conversation from one
cube to the next as &ldquo;convection currents of information&quot;4 and promotes the
benefits that might arise from incidental communication. But when one is trying
to concentrate, these currents of information become rip-tides of noise
pollution that one cannot escape. The result is frustration and aggravation for
the party on the listening end.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, companies that produce modular office furniture claim that
cubicles are fabulous, and choose to selectively ignore their manifest
disadvantages. In the advertising literature7 for their &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; furniture
system, Herman Miller lauds the necessity of teamwork: All the accepted research
in this field says you have to have more visual and acoustic openness to get the
benefits of a team-based organization. &hellip; and downplays the need for individual
work:</p>
<p>Although there will always be types of work that require intense concentration
and protection from distraction, our research suggests that these needs can be
effectively met outside assigned, enclosed workstations – through
remote work locations or on-site, shared, &ldquo;quiet rooms&rdquo; for instance. In other
words, the workplace should be optimized for collaborative work, and those who
want to concentrate can go elsewhere. Indeed, it seems to be a growing
misconception amongst designers and managers that a high level of interaction
and collaboration is a universal good, the more the better, and that the
downsides don&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>For knowledge workers, who spend the vast majority of their time in isolated
contemplation, this is decidedly bad news. Those who fit out offices seem to be
either gullible enough to believe glib rhetoric such as the above, or more
likely, choose to remain willfully ignorant of the fundamental requirements of
their staff. Herman Miller would have you believe that the cubicle environment
is good for your software development effort as well:</p>
<p>But the benefits of physical openness are gaining recognition even among the
&ldquo;gold-collar&rdquo; engineers and programmers of Silicon Valley. &ldquo;The programming code
we write has to work together seamlessly, so we should work together seamlessly
as well&rdquo;, says a Netscape Communication programmer and open-plan advocate quoted
recently in the New York Times.</p>
<p>Clearly, it is inane to suggest that software can be invested with desirable
runtime behavior by adopting parallel behavior in the team that develops it.
Does the code execute more quickly if we write it more quickly? Will it be more
user friendly if the developers are more friendly toward each other? No
– it is just nonsensical wordplay. But the use of such faulty &ldquo;proof
by metaphor&rdquo; techniques is illustrative of how desperate the furniture industry
is to ignore the workplace realities they are producing, and the superficial
level of thought that they employ in promoting their ostensible success.</p>
<p>Consider the following statement, again from Herman Miller:</p>
<p>Recent studies also indicate that people become habituated to background office
noise after prolonged exposure. Over time, people get used to the sounds of a
given environment, and noises that initially have a negative impact on
performance eventually lose their disruptive effect. Or perhaps, workers simply
give up on the issue of office noise after their prolonged attempts to deal with
it are continually met with stonewalling and denial. No references are given, so
it is impossible to gauge the validity or relevance of these studies. But it
sounds so inconsistent with known research in this area that one cannot help but
be suspicious.</p>
<p>Many studies have examined the effect of background speech on human
performance.5 One phenomena that consistently recurs is the &ldquo;Irrelevant Speech
Effect&rdquo; (ISE). In ISE experiments, participants are given tasks to do while
being subject to speech that is unrelated to the task at hand. Susceptibility to
ISE varies between individuals, but in general ISE is found to be &ldquo;detrimental
to reading comprehension, short-term memory, proofreading and mathematical
computations.&ldquo;6 In general, work that requires focus and ongoing access to
short-term memory will suffer in the presence of ISE and other distractions and
interruptions.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-about-status">It&rsquo;s About Status</h3>
<p>Real estate has always been an indicator of status. Whether you&rsquo;re a feudal lord
or a middle manager, the area in your command is usually proportional to your
perceived status and importance. Those who suggest that the cubicle is an
unavoidable part of the office landscape are often those whose status precludes
them from ever having to occupy one, and who have a vested interest in the
distribution of office space remaining exactly as it is – in their
favor. The unstated purpose of the cubicle is to serve as a container for the
&ldquo;have-nots&rdquo;, to more obviously distinguish them from the &ldquo;haves.&rdquo; The
preoccupation with offices (and the number of windows therein) and car parking
spaces is often quite baffling to techies, who think first in terms of utility
rather than perception. But for those more &ldquo;image oriented,&rdquo; the true worth of
corporate real estate has nothing to do with functionality and everything to do
with positioning.</p>
<h2 id="float-your-mind-upstream">Float Your Mind Upstream</h2>
<p>I would like to be able to say that companies are gradually realizing that
knowledge workers such as software developers need support for both team
interaction and distraction-free individual work, and are making changes to
workplace accommodation accordingly. But I would be lying.</p>
<p>In truth, the workplace&rsquo;s suitability as a place to work is likely to sink below
even its currently deplorable standard. The trend is towards ever smaller
cubicles with fewer and lower dividing partitions. A 1990 study by Reder and
Schwab found that the average duration of uninterrupted work for developers in a
particular software development firm was 10 minutes. That&rsquo;s revealing, because
it generally takes about 15 minutes to descend into that deep state of
contemplative involvement in work called &ldquo;flow&rdquo;. During the period in which one
is transitioning to a state of flow, one is particularly sensitive to noise and
interruption7. If you&rsquo;re interrupted every 10 minutes or so, chances are you
spend your day struggling to focus on what you&rsquo;re doing, being constantly
prevented from thoughtful contemplation of the problem before you by visual and
auditory distractions around you &hellip; and that&rsquo;s the typical working day of many
software developers. As DeMarco and Lister comment &ldquo;In most of the office space
we encounter today, there is enough noise and interruption to make any serious
thinking virtually impossible.&rdquo; With the addition of some doors into the
environment, developers could at least control their noise exposure.</p>
<p>Look around you now, and what do you see? Chances are there will be at least one
and probably many of your colleagues wearing headphones. It&rsquo;s common practice
for software developers to retreat into an isolated sonic world as the only way
they have of overcoming the incessant distraction around them. Some companies
pipe white noise into individual cubicles to try and mask the surrounding noise.
I&rsquo;ve found it helpful to run a few USB-powered fans from my computer
– their quiet hum serves much the same purpose, as well as
compensating for the often inadequate air conditioning.</p>
<p>Why don&rsquo;t developers revolt? Why is it so rare to hear them vocalize their
complaints? Talk to them in private and they&rsquo;ll likely concede that their work
environment is too noisy to enable them to work effectively. But they&rsquo;re
unlikely to make those concerns public, for fear of retribution or simply
because they know that the noise level will be dismissed as being an inherently
intractable problem.</p>
<p>So we will continue to grind our teeth and shake our heads in disbelief while
listening to the dull roar of the combined efforts of the printers, fax
machines, photocopiers, telephones, speakerphones, inconsiderate coworkers,
slamming doors, hallway conversations immediately beside our desks and wonder
how we can be expected to work effectively amidst such a furor. And as long as
developers continue to tolerate unsatisfactory noise levels, and work longer
hours to compensate for their negative effect on their productivity,
organizations will continue to ignore their dissatisfaction.</p>
