Anyone who has had any substantial dealings with technical recruiters invariably has a poor opinion of them. This is because the standard of practice in the recruiting industry is so low. To be a recruiter you don’t need any formal qualification, or any particular experience.

Recruiting, as it is generally practiced, is little more than telemarketing. As with telemarketing, people are drawn to it because of the opportunity to make money without having to satisfy any particular educational requirements. A recruiter’s commission is generally 15-20% of the candidate’s first year’s salary, which explains why recruiters are not generally altruistically motivated. They share the ethical and moral shortcomings of workers in other commission-based occupations such as used car salesmen, real estate agents and pimps.

In your interaction with recruiters, it pays to keep the following firmly in mind:
• Therecruiterisfirstandforemostasalesman,sotheirprimeobjective is to make money. They do this by finding someone who satisfies their client’s requirements for long enough to earn them a commission.
• You don’t need the recruiter’s good favor, you just need to convince them to pass your resume onto their client. Because recruiters are universally maligned, their clients have no more respect for their opinions than you do.
• The recruiter has no technical knowledge. The skills you’ve spent years acquiring are just empty keywords and acronyms to them.
• Neverallowyourselftobetalkedintodoingsomethingyoudon’twant to. Recruiters are good talkers, and know how to railroad the introverted techie into a particular course of action. They will speak quickly, loudly and with unwarranted familiarity in order to influence you into doing what they want.
• Aboveall,rememberthatit’syourcareeryou’redealingwith.Youare the only one who exercises any control over that, not the recruiter.

When I began speaking with recruiters again recently, I went in search of a guide to help me deal with them more effectively. Finding no such guide available, I decide to write one. The following presents some tips on dealing with that most useless of creatures, the IT recruiter.
Phone Calls

Tip: Don’t Bother Leaving Voicemails
You will find that recruiters rarely return your voicemail messages. The perceived justification for this discourtesy is "I’m too busy,” although the real reason is "Contacting you doesn’t hold the immediate promise of financial reward". Therefore, don’t bother to leave messages – keep calling until you can speak to them in person.

Tip: Be Cautious When Answering Certain Questions
Recruiters will try and gather more information than is necessary, in the hope of learning something that can be used to their advantage. Only discuss what is strictly relevant to the job in question. In particular, look out for the following questions:

Do You Have Any Other Opportunities In Hand?
Recruiters will often make a "friendly enquiry" about how your job hunting prospects are at the moment. This is not idle small talk. The recruiter is trying to gauge:
• Howdesperateyouarei.e.howmuchleveragetheyhave
• The number of opportunities out there for people with your skill set.
At best, this enquiry could be called "market research."
• The names of companies that are currently hiring – so they can approach them.
It is of no advantage to you to provide any of this information to the recruiter, and it could weaken your bargaining position in future. A suitable response might be “I’d prefer not to discuss the status of my job search.” Above all, never appear desperate – it will be a signal to the recruiter that they can get away with dramatically cutting your rate, thereby increasing their profit margin.

What Recruiter Did You Apply Through?

If you tell them you have already made application for the position through another recruiter, they may try and find out who that recruiter is, and what agency they work for. It’s none of their business – tell them so. The same response as above will suffice.
Do You Know Anyone Else Who Might Be Interested In This Job?
Here, the recruiter is trying to get you to refer them to another candidate. Never do this, if you want to keep your friends. Once that information gets into the recruiter’s hands, there is no telling what will happen to it. The only appropriate answer to the above question is “no.” If you do know someone who is interested, still tell the recruiter “no”, and then contact that person yourself so they can approach the recruiter at their leisure, if they so choose.
Who Did You Work For While You Were At Company X?
A common technique recruiters use to broaden their client base is to use candidates to get contacts within companies the candidate has worked for. For example:
Recruiter: Did you work for fictional-name while you were at J-Corp? You: No – I’ve never heard of fictional-name. I reported to John
Smith.
Now the recruiter has a contact name within J-Corp that they can use to get past the company switchboard (companies often have switchboard blocks on recruiters). They can ring J-Corp’s switchboard, ask to speak to John Smith – without revealing that they are a recruiter – and be in a position to market their services directly to someone who is reasonably senior.
What Was Your Rate/Salary In Your Last Contract/Job?
The danger in quoting a contract rate is that the rate at which you actually work (assuming you’re awarded the contract) is yet to be negotiated. If the recruiter can subsequently negotiate a higher rate with his client, he can keep that information to himself and absorb the surplus into his margin.

Tip: Learn A Few Rote Answers

All recruiters tend to ask the same questions. It may surprise you to know that recruiters often follow scripts – the same way that telemarketers follow scripts when cold calling potential customers. They may have worked with the script so long that they’ve now internalized it, or perhaps they’ve developed the script themselves, refining it over the course of hundreds of phone calls. The point is, the recruiter is far more rehearsed in asking questions than you are in providing answers. To level the playing field, you can prepare your own scripts by rehearsing answers to some commonly asked questions:

Why Did You Leave Your Last Job?

Some recruiters will ask this, as if they had the right to know and could put the info to any sensible use. Prepare a brief and suitably vague answer that suggests you bear no animosity towards your last employer, and that your performance wasn’t questioned in any way. A tried and true comeback is “It was just time for a change” – which is impossible to refute or question further.

What Is Your Ideal Job?

Occasionally a recruiter asks this, just on the off chance that your ideal job is currently on their books. Not surprisingly, it never is. They’re not really interested in your response, so much as that you have one and asking it makes it sound like they’re displaying due diligence. Learn a brief and dismissive answer.

Tip: Determine The Purpose Of The Call Early In The Conversation

It’s not uncommon to have recruiters contact you even though they don’t actually have a suitable position to discuss with you – the operative word being “suitable.” You may find that they have a position that is clearly unsuitable for you, but will try and use that position to establish contact with you, ask you to come and see them for a chat, and generally begin the recruiting process. These recruiters are desperate and are trying to match the few positions they have to whatever candidature they can dig up, no matter how inappropriate the match. Don’t let them waste your time. If they’re not prepared to put a job specification down on the table, walk away.

Tip: Protect Your Referees From Unnecessary Interruption

There’s no need to put “references available upon request” on your resume – that is understood. Out of consideration for your referees, you should aim to minimize the number of occasions they are contacted. Therefore, never give away your references until there is a job offer on the table, for the following reasons:
• Some recruiters will use your referees as contact points for marketing their services.
• If the recruiter contacts your referees, there is no guarantee that their client will not also want to contact them. Then your referees end up getting hounded with phone calls.
• If the recruiter contacts your referees prior to a job offer being made, and the client does not decide to hire you, then your referees have been pestered for nothing.
Some recruiters will try to tell you that they can’t even submit your resume to their client without references. This is nonsense, and certainly an attempt to collect your referees as contacts.

Tip: Be Suspicious Of Calls From Agents You’ve Never Heard Of

Once you have been circulating your resume for a while, and it has been entered in the résumé databases of enough agencies, you’ll find that you start getting cold calls from agents that you’ve never heard of. What’s happened in these cases is that the agent has done a keyword search on their agency’s résumé database for a particular skill set, got back several dozen matches, and then placed a phone call to every person whose resume was a match. Your resume happens to be in the agencies database as a result of your previous contact with some other agent working at that agency.

If an unknown recruiter leaves you a message, if you do call them back, you can expect the following:
• Therecruiterdoesn’trememberwhoyouare.
• The recruiter doesn’t remember what job description they rang you in
relation to.
• Once they’ve worked out those two things, they search their database for your résumé.
• Then they read out their job’s skill requirements and you have to respond “yes” or “no” to each ... even though that info is on the screen in front of them.
For this reason I generally don’t return calls from recruiters I’ve never heard of. I have better things to do than read out my résumé over the phone.

Tricks Of The Trade Trick: Bait And Switch

This is an old salesman’s scam that still finds application in the recruiting industry. The practice consists of luring in a candidate with an inviting (but inaccurate or incomplete) job description, and once the candidate is “hooked”, revealing the true nature of the position. The hope is that the sense of positive expectation already created will make the candidate more receptive to the true job description.

Trick: Salary/Contract Rate Negotiation

Never forget that the recruiter is paid by the client company to find employees, and he who pays the bill gets the service. Perhaps this is the way recruiters self-justify their poor treatment of candidates. It is also significant when the recruiter is negotiating a salary/rate on your behalf – they are negotiating with the same party that pays their commission, so it is as well to have a good idea of what money you’re worth and to set definite boundaries for the recruiter so that you don’t get sold out. Recruiters will try and get you to lower your rate by claiming that their client has one or more alternatives of similar experience/ability as yourself, and they are willing to work at a lower rate. You can never tell whether your competitors are real or are phantoms created by the recruiter. Any enquiries you might make to determine the authenticity of these competitors will be foiled by the recruiter’s claims of privileged information.

Trick: Vague Job Descriptions

At times, recruiters will publish deliberately vague job descriptions in the hope of garnering as wide a response as possible. Their motivation is in part to refresh their internal resume database, and in part to assess the amount of interest associated with particular skills sets (market research). There may be an actual job behind it all, or there may not.

Trick: Agent Interviews

The “agent interview” is one of the biggest conceits in the recruiting industry. A small percentage of recruiters will want to speak with you in person before putting your résumé forward to their client. Some will even claim that they are required by company policy to do so. The ostensible purpose of these chats is for the recruiter to get a better idea of who you are, thereby enabling them to present your strengths more effectively to their client. If you were wondering exactly what a recruiter will learn about you in a 20 minute chat that they can’t gather over the phone, then you wouldn’t be the first. The real purpose of agent interviews are:
• For the recruiter to see how attractive you are. Statistically, good- looking candidates are more likely to interview successfully. If the recruiter has a choice of candidates to put forward, they are better off choosing the more attractive ones. Of course, discrimination based on appearance is illegal, so you’ll never hear any public admission that this sort of assessment occurs.
• To increase your degree of investment in the agent and the job. Once you’ve gone to the effort of meeting with a recruiter, you will have a natural tendency in future to act in a way that retrospectively justifies having made that investment. In future you are more likely to favor that agent, and to be more kindly disposed towards positions put forward by that agent. If this sort of psychological manipulation strikes you as being beyond the average recruiter’s capability, remember that most recruiters have at least an intuitive grasp of sales techniques. Exploiting your need to appear consistent with previous actions is a common technique employed by salesmen. The door-to- door salesman who offers a free demonstration of his product knows that the hidden expense is the cost of your time, which is only justified if you later make a purchase. The car salesman who lets you take a vehicle for a test drive is relying upon the same principle.
• To establish a power dynamic. It is significant that you go to the recruiter, and not the other way around. This suggests that the recruiter is in control, as they would like to believe, and as they would like you to believe.

Trick: X-Rayers And Phone Lists

Recruiters will go to extraordinary lengths to get leads to clients and candidates. There are a number of software packages available, called web site “x-rayers” or “flippers”, designed to automatically probe corporate websites for names and phone numbers. Lurking on Usenet groups is another way of getting relevant email addresses. Looking to fill a Java job? A few weeks lurking on comp.lang.java enables the recruiter to identify the technically savvy and geographically appropriate posters. I suspect the vast majority of recruiters are not technically savvy enough to use these sorts of techniques. However, that such possibilities exist does illustrate why it’s worthwhile being very careful with how much information you give away.
Trick: Wooden Ducks
Particularly unscrupulous recruiters will submit candidates to their client to act as placeholders – for the purposes of making another candidate appear good by comparison. It’s going to be difficult to determine when you are being used as a wooden duck because you have no knowledge of the other candidates your recruiter is putting forward. Tell tale signs may be:
• The recruiter is pushing hard for you to attend an interview, even though they have previously expressed doubts about your chances against other candidates.
• The recruiter makes no effort to coach you about the interview, what to expect or how to prepare.
• The recruiter has hinted that you may be competing against internal candidates i.e. candidates already employed by the client.
• Therecruiterhasmadestatementssuchas“notgettingyourhopesup” or similar, indicating they are anticipating failure.
