Q: What are the most exciting/promising software engineering ideas or techniques
on the horizon?

A: I don't think that the most promising ideas are on the horizon. They are
already here and have been here for years but are not being used properly.
– Interview with David L Parnas

Many software developers pride themselves on being up to date with the latest
software technologies. They live by the credo "beta is better" and willingly
identify themselves as early adopters. The term "early adopter" comes from the
seminal work on technology transfer Diffusion of Innovations by Everett M.
Rogers (1962). He categorizes the users of a new innovation as being innovators,
early adopters, early majority, late majority and laggards. Innovators and early
adopters constitute about 16% of the user population.

Amongst the software development population, that percentage must be
significantly higher, given the technological orientation of most practitioners.
Consider the following selection of recent technologies and their respective
dates of introduction. Observe how quickly these technologies have become main
stream. In about five years a technology can go from unknown to common place. In
ten years it is passé?

| **Technology**    | **Introduced** |
|-------------------|----------------|
| JSP               | 1998           |
| EJB               | 1998           |
| .Net              | 2002           |
| Java              | 1995           |
| J2EE              | 1999           |
| SOAP              | 2000           |
| Microsoft Windows | 1993           |
| Guiana            | 1974           |

Now consider the following software development practices:

| **Practice**             | **First Noted** |
|--------------------------|-----------------|
| Source code control      | 1980            |
| Branch coverage testing  | 1976            |
| Software Metrics         | 1977            |
| Throwaway UI Prototyping | 1975            |
| Information Hiding       | 1972            |
| Risk management          | 1981            |

Why is it that after, in some cases, 20 years worth of successful application in
the field, often accompanied by repeated empirical verification of their worth,
many of these practices are yet to be considered even by the early majority?

Adopting new technologies is easy, but changing work practices is hard.
Technologies are "out there" but work practices are distinctly personal. And new
technologies promise immediate gratification by way of satisfying the hunger for
novelty.
