The word "argument" has negative connotations for many people. It is associated
with heated exchanges and passionate disagreement. But your experience of
argument need not be so negative. Consider that the word 'argument' also means
'a line of reasoning'. By approaching a verbal or electronic discussion, even a
hostile one, with this definition in mind, you can learn to separate the logical
content of the exchange from its emotional content and thereby deal with each
more effectively. You may even find the process of so doing an agreeable one.

The following are a few tips and techniques that I've learnt in the course of a
great many arguments, flame wars and other "vigorous discussions" that may help
you argue more purposefully, and thereby come to view argument as a stimulating
activity to be relished, rather than an ordeal to be avoided.


## You Can Be Right, But You Can't Win {#you-can-be-right-but-you-can-t-win}

At the end of a formal debate, one or more adjudicators decides which team are
the victors. If only it were that clean cut in real life. A good portion of the
time, arguments arise spontaneously, continue in a haphazard manner and then
fizzle out without any clear resolution or outcome. When you cannot force your
opponent to concede their losses or acknowledge your victories, it becomes
impossible to keep score. Therefore you should not enter any dispute,
particularly an online one, with visions of your ultimate rhetorical triumph, in
which you lord your argumentative superiority over your opponent, who shirks
away, cap in hand and ego in tatters. It's not going to happen.

So why engage in argument at all, if you can never win? Here are a few possible
motivations:

## Remain As Dispassionate As Possible {#remain-as-dispassionate-as-possible}

This is at once the most difficult and the most valuable aspect of arguing
effectively. Strong emotion can cloud your thinking and inhibit your ability to
reason objectively and thoroughly. Anger is what turns a discussion into an
argument and then into a flame war. Responses you give while angry are likely to
be poorly considered, so it is invaluable to have techniques at your disposal to
moderate that anger so that you can argue at your best and even begin to enjoy
the dispute. Here are a few techniques that might be useful:

-   When you're not arguing in real-time (e.g. via email or discussion forums),
    print out the email or message that you've found inflammatory. Read it
    somewhere away from the computer and plan how you will respond. Delay making
    your actual response as long as possible.
-   When arguing in person, make a deliberate effort to slow down the pace of the
    discussion and lower its volume. If you're uncomfortable with the silence
    created, adopt a thoughtful expression and pretend to be considering your
    reply carefully. Use the time created to take a few deep breaths and calm
    down.
-   Adopt a different mental posture towards the email or message. Pretend that
    the message is for someone else. This helps to de- personalize the argument
    and put it at a distance.

Realizing that your opponent is as susceptible to emotion as you are, you may
choose to use this to your advantage. Here we venture out of the realm of the
logical and into the rhetorical. If you can identify your opponent's "hot
buttons," then you may be able to goad them into making an unconsidered
response. Once made, the response cannot be retracted and you may be able to
play that advantage for the remainder of the argument. When being inflammatory
or provocative, be careful not to overdo it. Lest you appear vitriolic or
juvenile, make your barbs short and well targeted. Ensure that they are offered
as parenthetical asides rather than as a basis for argument.

Perhaps the most effective means of disarming your opponent's insults is with
wit, as demonstrated by the following exchange between Winston Churchill and
Lady Asbury:

Lady Asbury: Mr. Churchill, if you were my husband, I would put poison in your wine.
Churchill: Madam, if you were my wife, I would drink it.


## Be Familiar With The Basic Logical Fallacies {#be-familiar-with-the-basic-logical-fallacies}

Those not skilled in argument are often prone to employing logical fallacies and
being unaware that they are doing so. It is vital that you be able to recognize
at least the basic logical fallacies so that you don't end up trying to attack
an insensible argument, or formulating one yourself. Common logical fallacies
include:

-   Straw Man Argument – Your opponent restates your argument inaccurately and in a weaker form, then refutes the weaker argument as if it were your own.
-   Argumentum Ad Hominem – Ad hominem means 'to the man'. Your opponent attacks you rather than your argument. If you choose to insult your opponent in order to provoke an emotional reaction, be sure that your insults are not used as part of your argument, otherwise you will be guilty of argumentum ad hominem yourself.
-   Appeal to Popularity – The suggestion that because something is popular it must be good, or because something is widely believed it must be true.
-   Hasty Generalization – Making an unjustified generalization from too little evidence or only a few examples.
-   AppealtoIgnorance–Claimingthatsomethingistruebecausethereis no evidence that it is false.
-   Appeal to Authority – Claiming that something is true because someone important says that it is.


## Seek Precision {#seek-precision}

It's easy to end up arguing at cross-purposes with someone simply because you
each have different definitions in mind for component terms of the subject being
debated. So a good starting point when engaging in debate is to first ensure
that you and your opponent have precisely the same understanding of the topic
being argued. Remarkably often, the act of precisely defining the topic will
serve to circumvent any subsequent argument, as it becomes clear that the
warring parties do not have conflicting positions on a given subject, but
instead are talking about different subjects entirely.


## Ask Pointed Questions {#ask-pointed-questions}

There are several reasons why you might choose to ask your opponent questions:

-   Toseekclarificationonapointthattheyhavemade
-   In the hope that some of the information volunteered will be faulty, thereby
    providing you with fuel for rebuttal.
-   To save effort on your part. It often takes less effort to ask a question than
    answer it. In a protracted exchange, this economy of effort can be important.
    It also gives you time to think about your next move.
-   Because you know the answer. A powerful rhetorical technique is to ask a
    series of questions that leads your opponent, by degrees, to the realization
    that their answer is in contradiction with statements they have previously
    made.

For example, suppose you are arguing the merits of free software with one of
Richard Stallman's disciples. You might question the Free Software Advocate
(FSA) to tease out the inconsistencies in their philosophy:

FSA: All software should be "free", as in "freedom"
You: How do define "free", exactly?
FSA: "Free" means that you can do with it whatever you want. You: With no restrictions at all?
FSA: Yes - you have absolute freedom to do with it whatever you please. Anything else is an attempt to take away your freedom.
You: Then I would be free to make it non-free if I wanted to?
FSA: Ummm ... I guess so.
You: But wouldn't that contradict your original statement that "all software should be free"?
If the last response from the FSA had been different, the argument might have headed in a different direction:
You: Then I would be free to make it non-free if I wanted to?
FSA: No - that's the exception. You can't inhibit the freedom of others.
You: But doesn't that mean that I'm not really free? Specifically, I'm not free to inhibit the freedom of others?
FSA: Sure, but you have to draw the line when it comes to fundamental liberties.
You: And what basis do you have for claiming that free use of software is a fundamental liberty?
... and so the FSA is led to an awareness of the circular reasoning they are employing.


## Don't Claim More Than You Have To {#don-t-claim-more-than-you-have-to}

A common error is to extend the claims you're making to a broader scope than is
really necessary to make your point. In doing so, you extend the logical
territory that you have to defend and permit counter-argument on a broader
front. This is one of the primary benefits of maintaining a skeptical attitude.
Skeptics assume as little as possible, and therefore have less to defend than
True Believers who are prone to making broad assumptions and sweeping
generalizations.

Suppose you're arguing about the quality of open source software versus
proprietary software. An open source zealot may make a broad claim such as "Open
source software is always of higher quality than proprietary software". A
universal qualifier such as "always" makes their claim easy to disprove
– all that is required is a single counter-example. A more cautious
open source enthusiast might claim "Open source software is usually of higher
quality than proprietary software", which is a narrower claim than the one made
by the zealot, but one still requiring evidential support. A skeptic might ask
"How do you define quality?"

Claims can be accidentally over-extended by provision of a flawed example of the
general point you're making. Your opponent counters the particular example
you've provided and then assumes victory over the general claim it was supposed
to be illustrating. Before choosing to illustrate your general claim with a
specific example, be very sure the example is a true instance of your general
case. It may be more prudent to leave out your example all together.


## Seek Evidence {#seek-evidence}

It's easy to make bold claims and impressive assertions; it's not so easy to
back them up with proof. A common problem in argument is the failure to identify
which party carries the burden of proof, and to what extent that burden exists.
The general rule is this: He who makes the claim carries the burden of proving
it. If you claim "Linux is more reliable than Windows", then it is your
responsibility to not only specify your definition of "more reliable" but to
provide evidence that supports your claim. Your claim is not "provisionally
true" until someone can prove you wrong; and neither is it false. It's truth or
otherwise is simply unknown.

This is an area of common misunderstanding amongst those with pseudo-scientific
beliefs. For instance, UFO believers will look at a history of UFO sightings for
some region and note that although 99% have been attributed to aircraft, weather
balloons and such, 1% of them are still unexplained. They delight in this 1%
figure as if it were vindication of their beliefs. But 1% being "unknown" does
not equate to "1% being alien beings in spaceships". It might also mean that the
1% of reports were simply too vague or incomplete to permit any kind of
conclusion being reached. Those claiming by implication that the 1% represent
alien beings carry the burden of proving that with evidence.

But always remain aware of the context in which claims are made. Different
contexts bring with them different levels of formality, and consequently
different evidentiary standards. If your friend remarks "Boy it's hot outside",
it's obviously not appropriate to insist upon meteorological data to back up
their claim. But if an environmental activist claims "average daytime
temperature world-wide has risen an average of 0.5 degrees in the last century"
then the first thing you'll be wanting to know is where the data came from that
supports that claim.


## When Your Opponent Is Irrational {#when-your-opponent-is-irrational}

Finally, there is a delicate ethical issue to consider when arguing. Every so
often you find yourself locking horns with someone who appears to have a fairly
shaky grip on reality. I'm not referring to simple eccentricity or religious
fervor, but psychiatric illness. For examples, you can refer to some of the
emails received by the James Randi Educational Foundation1 (JREF) in response to
their million dollar challenge. James Randi is a well known skeptic and
magician. Since 1994, the JREF has offered a prize of one million dollars to
anyone able to demonstrate paranormal or supernatural abilities or phenomena
under controlled observational conditions. To date, no one has successfully
claimed that prize. But some of the applications2 they receive suggest that the
respondent is unwell, perhaps delusional. If you should find yourself in online
discussion with someone whom you suspect is unencumbered by the restrictions of
rational thought, then perhaps the best you can do is exit the discussion
immediately. To continue is to risk antagonizing someone who may be genuinely
dangerous. This is one of the prime reasons for conducting online arguments
anonymously, where possible.


## Knowing When To Quit {#knowing-when-to-quit}

There comes a point when you want to exit an argument. Perhaps you've grown
bored with it; perhaps it has become clear that your opponent's views are so
heavily entrenched that progress is impossible; perhaps your opponent is
offering only insults without any logical content. Here are a few ways of
bringing the argument to a definite conclusion, rather than just letting it
peter out:

-   Simplywalkaway.Foronlinearguments,refusetorespond.
-   Insistthatanytopicscoveredthusfarberesolvedbeforetheargument continues. This
    prevents your opponent switching subjects and responding to your rebuttals by
    simply making a new batch of assertions.
-   Ask your opponent what they hope to gain by continuing the argument. To what
    end are they arguing.


## Reconstruct Your Opponent's Argument {#reconstruct-your-opponent-s-argument}

Argument reconstruction is the process of analysis the verbal or written form of
an argument and identifying the premises (both explicit and implied) and the
conclusions it contains. To effectively rebut your opponent's arguments you need
to know exactly what they are claiming, and upon what basis they are claiming
it.

For each premise you identify, consider whether the premise is true or false. If
you think one or more of them is false, call attention to each of them and ask
your opponent to justify them with evidence. If the conclusions don't follow
logically from the premises, call attention to the logical error. If the
conclusion cannot be true without one or more unstated premises also being true,
then call your opponent's attention to their reliance upon implicit premises
and, where those premises are in doubt, insist that evidence be provided in
support of them.
