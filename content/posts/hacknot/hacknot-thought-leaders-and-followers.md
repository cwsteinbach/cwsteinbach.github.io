For a brief, shining moment there was hope. Through the exaggeration and braggadocio that so permeates the conversation of the Agile community, there came a fleeting glimpse of self-awareness – a flash of social perspective that could have precipitated a greater moderation and rationality in the methodological discourse. And then it was gone – swept aside by the force of yet another ill-considered generalization.

I’m referring to a recent blog entry by Martin Fowler entitled AppealToAuthority.1 In this entry, Fowler relates how he occasionally receives the comment "When a guru like you says something, lots of people will blindly do exactly what you say." Fowler denies the existence of such an effect, and counters that what appear to be appeals to authority may really be just an artifact of lazy argument or sloppy self-expression.

The argument from authority is everywhere in the Agile and XP communities, and is a far more potent force than Fowler seems to appreciate. Here are just a few ways that the various so-called "thought leaders" and "spokesmen" employ direct and indirect appeals to authority.
• Statements prefixed with "In my experience", combined with the suggestion that this experience is extensive, are attempts to cast the speaker as a seasoned veteran whose word should be taken seriously. Having many years of experience only establishes that one is old, not that one is correct.
• Sweeping statements and broad generalizations can make for powerful-sounding oratory, and suggest that the speaker possesses some kind of absolute knowledge i.e. that they are simply declaring information that they know to be factual. By abandoning the uncertainty and qualification, the speaker sacrifices accuracy for the sake of impact and elevates opinion to fact.
• Byinventingandpromulgatingcuteslogans,folksyhomiliesandother media-friendly sound bites, speakers encourage others to quote them verbatim and dogmatically. Such quotation invests the statement, and thereby the speaker, with a faux authority.
• With rare exception, the aforementioned comment from Fowler’s being one such case, the "thought-leaders" and "spokesmen" rarely acknowledge, let alone reject, their decoration with such grand titles. There is no attempt to discourage the use of such titles, beyond the occasional token self-deprecation.
• Speakers claiming to represent the opinions and experiences of a group are naturally encouraging a view of themselves as leaders. Such speakers will not hesitate to claim "The Agile community believes X" or "The XP community does X", even though the communities in question have not been consulted or surveyed, and in fact may have wildly varying and inconsistent views on the matter.

Fowler's claim that appeals to authority are not a significant influence strikes me as disingenuous. Not only are such appeals frequent, they are at the very heart of the rhetoric. It should be kept firmly in mind that those most outspoken in this space are almost always consultants specializing in AM/XP.2 Consultants make their money by promoting themselves as authorities on some subject, so that others will hire them for their perceived expertise.


## Ruin Your Career With Agility {#ruin-your-career-with-agility}

An interesting blog entry, author unknown, came to my attention recently. Entitled How Agile Development Ruined My Career (Sort Of)3 it is the story of a Senior Director’s attempts to introduce Agile work practices into a company, and the consequences for himself. I have commented on the blog itself, and the XP fraternity has just begun to dissect it on comp.software.extreme-programming4 (posted 23 May 2004) which should make for entertaining reading.
