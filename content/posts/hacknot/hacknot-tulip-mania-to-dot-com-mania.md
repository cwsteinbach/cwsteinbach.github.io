> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. -- George Santayana

Those of us working in IT tend to think of ourselves as being modern, savvy and
much more advanced than our forebears. This conviction is often accompanied by a
certain degree of hubris, and a somewhat derisive attitude towards older
technologies and practitioners. You’ve probably encountered this
ageist bias in your own work place, or even displayed it yourself. Older members
of our profession are viewed as out-dated and irrelevant. Older programming
languages such as C and FORTRAN are viewed as inherently inferior to those more
recently introduced such as Java and C#. Contempt for that which has come before
us is as common place as the fascination with novelty and invention that breeds
it.

In our struggle to stay abreast of the rapid rate of change in our industry, our focus is so intensely upon the present and immediate future, that we neglect the lessons of the past. We excuse our parochialism by kidding ourselves that the pace of technological makes any comparison with the past all but irrelevant anyway. But here lies a serious error in thinking – for although technology changes rapidly, people do not. For example, throughout history there are numerous examples of large groups of people succumbing to mass panics, group delusions and popular myths. Notable events are:
• The Martian Panic of 1938, in which many Americans became convinced that a radio broadcast of H.G. Well’s War of the Worlds was a news broadcast of an actual Martian invasion, leading some to flee their homes to escape the alien terror.1
• The Roswell Flying Saucer crash of 1947, a myth sustained by many even today.
• The widespread belief in Satanic Ritual Abuse of children in America in the 1970’s and 1980’s.
• The Witch Mania of the 15th-17th centuries on multiple continents. Exemplified by the Salem witch trials of 1692.
• TheFaceonMarsmythof1976

It is easy to dismiss such phenomena as unique to their times, the like of which
could never be experienced by modern, technology-aware, scientifically informed
people such as ourselves. But we view our modern world with old brains.
Psychologically, we have the same predilections and foibles as the witch-hunters
and alchemists of centuries past. We still experience greed, we still feel a
need to belong to a group, and we can still sustain false and irrational beliefs
if we see others doing the same.

To illustrate our continuing susceptibility to irrational group behaviors,
consider the Tulip Mania of the 1630s, which exhibits striking parallels with
the dot-com mania that would follow it some 400 years later.


## Tulip Mania {#tulip-mania}

The collecting of tulips began as a fashion amongst the wealthy in Holland and
Amsterdam in the late 16th century2. The popularity of the flower spread to
England in 1600, and filtered down from the upper class to the middle class. By
1635 the mania had reached its peak amongst the Dutch, and preposterous sums
were being paid for bulbs of the rarer varieties. A single bulb of the species
Admiral Liefken sold for 4400 florins, and a Semper Augustus for 5500 florins,
at a time when a sheep cost 10 florins.

In 1636 the demand for rare tulips became so great that regular marts for their
sale were established on the Stock Exchange of Amsterdam. At this time,
speculation in tulip bulbs appeared, and those fortunate enough to buy low and
sell high quickly grew rich. Seeing their friends and colleagues profiting from
the tulip mania, ordinary citizens began converting their property into cash and
investing in bulbs. All were convinced that Europe’s current
infatuation with tulips would continue unabated for the foreseeable future and
that vast wealth awaited those who could satiate the frenzied demands that were
sure to come from the rest of Europe.

But the more prudent began to see that this artificial price inflation could not
be sustained for much longer. As confidence dropped, so too did the market price
of tulips – never to rise again. Those caught with significant
investments in bulbs were ruined, and Holland’s economy suffered a
blow from which it took many years to recover.

There are obvious similarities with the dot com boom – the artificial
escalation of value, the widening scope of investors, the confusion of
popularity with substance, the progression from investor over-confidence to
widely held belief, and finally, the sudden deflation of value promoted by the
growing awareness of the role that non-financial factors were playing in the
trend.


## Conclusion {#conclusion}

It has always been the province of recent generations to view the mistakes of
earlier generations with a contempt derived from the assumption that they are
somehow immune to such follies. Those of us who are more technology-aware than
some others are particularly prone to this. And yet, even the geekiest
techno-junkie can fall prey to the same psychological and sociological traps
that have plagued our species for centuries. Indeed, far from inuring us to
metaphysical thinking, it seems that the sheer success of science has lead many
to deliberately pursue "alternative" beliefs as a way of restoring some feeling
of mystery and wonder into their lives. A 1990 Gallup poll of 1236 adult
Americans found that 52% believed in astrology, 46% in ESP and 19% in witches.3
The result is that superstition and technology are both coexistent and
symbiotic. As software developers, we need to heed the lessons of the mass
manias of the past, acknowledge that we are still psychologically vulnerable to
them today, and guard against their re-emergence by making a deliberate effort
to think critically about the trends, fashions and hype which so predominate our
industry.
